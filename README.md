**Local News Aggregation System Using Web Scraping(Yonse News)**

This is the project I worked on as my final year project for my Computer Science degree. 
It is a system the collects news from several local news sites and puts them in one place.

**Abstract**

Gift Kampamba, Mr. Martin Phiri, The University of Zambia (2023)

Aggregation by one definition on Google, is the collection of related items so that
they can be displayed or linked together. Web scraping, also known as web harvesting
or web data extraction, refers to the process of extracting data from websites or web
pages by sending HTTP requests, parsing the HTML or other structured documents,
and then saving the extracted data in a structured format, such as a spreadsheet or a
database. The scraper can then replicate the entire website content elsewhere.
Local news data, which is the focus here, is thus scraped and aggregated as implied
above. This collected media is displayed on a single website called Yonse, a robust
platform utilizing bots to extract content and data from websites across the nation, at
any given time.

This project presents a proof of concept for a system that aggregates scraped news
articles from various local news websites. It employs an iterative and
incremental development approach, enabling gradual growth in size and features,
ensuring a dynamic and comprehensive final system.

**Instructions**

To run this project, clone it, and then run the command "pip install -r requirements" to install dependecncies
in the project root folder. Also create a .env file and set and a secret_key.
